## Build & Run

Clone [electronegativity](git@github.com:doyensec/electronegativity.git) and proceed with the following:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ node dist/index.js -h
```

## Creating new checks

Electronegativity is build in such a way to easily allow the development of new security checks.

There are three different check types:

* JS (using a combination of [Esprima](http://esprima.org/), [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel), [TypeScript ESTree](https://github.com/JamesHenry/typescript-estree))
* HTML (using [Cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio))
* JSON (using the native `JSON.parse()`)

Depending on the target file (e.g. evaluating a property in a JavaScript file -> JS), you will need to:

1. Create a new file in `/src/finder/checks`
2. Create a new class with a `match()` function, which should contain the logic of your custom check
   * JS -> `match(astNode, astHelper)`
   * HTML -> `match(cheerioObj, content)`
   * JSON -> `match(content)`
3. Add a constructor that specifies the check details such as name, description, etc. 

For example:

```js
import { sourceTypes } from '../../parser/types';

export default class MyCustomHTMLCheck {
    constructor() {
        this.id = 'MY_CUSTOM_HTML_CHECK';
        this.description = `this is a custom check`;
        this.type = sourceTypes.JAVASCRIPT;
    }

    match(cheerioObj, content){
        //do magic
        //either return an object with row and col, or null meaning no issues were identified
    }
}

```

Take a look at the different checks in `/src/finder/checks` to get an idea on how things work.

### GlobalChecks

These non-standard checks are executed after the first round of standard Checks and they work on the array of issues generated by the first batch of Checks to determine further vulnerabilities or discard false positives. Using this class of checks provides an improved decisional process, which comes in handy for checks that needs to scan every JS/HTML of the target application before determining the presence or absence of a vulnerability.
To achieve this, it is possible for standard checks to share an additional properties object when added to the initial issues array, that can later be used by any GlobalCheck to perform decisions. These checks are located in `src/finder/checks/ComplexChecks/` and share a very similar loading mechanism to that of the standard checks. Every time you will create a new ComplexChecks you will need to add it in the ComplexChecks loader (`src/finder/checks/ComplexChecks/index.js`).

Note that if a GlobalCheck needs other checks to be performed before its execution, you may declare this by setting a `depends` array property in its `constructor()` function (e.g. `this.depends = ["CSPJSCheck", "CSPHTMLCheck"];`). 


### Naming conventions

* The classname (and file) for each check uses CamelCase notation with the following convention: 
```<NAME><TYPE>Check``` (e.g. AllowPopupHTMLCheck)

where `NAME` is a self-descriptive identifier

where `TYPE` can be *HTML*, *JSON* or *JS* 

* The ```<CHECK_NAME_IDENTIFIER>``` (class id) uses uppercase notation with the following convention: ```<NAME_UNDERSCORE_SEPARATED>_<TYPE>_CHECK``` (e.g. ALLOWPOPUPS_HTML_CHECK).

* GlobalChecks also use the uppercase notation with the following convention: ```<NAME_UNDERSCORE_SEPARATED>_GLOBAL_CHECK``` (e.g. CSP_GLOBAL_CHECK).


## Testing checks with Mocha

### Standard checks

Test cases for standard checks unit testing are placed in `test/checks/`.

Filenames for tests should have the following format: ```<CHECK_NAME_IDENTIFIER>_<test number #>_<number of issues>.<js|htm|html>```

For instance, the ```NODE_INTEGRATION_JS_CHECK_1_0.js ``` will be analyzed using the ```NODE_INTEGRATION_JS_CHECK``` check and the test is expected to find ```0``` issues.

The `test number #` part should always be progressive, even if two tests share the same structure but a different number of issues.

### Global checks

Test cases for global checks unit testing are implemented as directories stored in `test/checks/GlobalChecks/`.
Each directory is named following the same standard checks naming convention and contains the files necessary for the test to run. E.g. taking CSP global check, the directory structure for positive and negative tests looks like this:
```
test
    checks
        GlobalChecks
            CSP_GLOBAL_CHECK_1_0
                index.html
                main.js
                renderer.js
            CSP_GLOBAL_CHECK_1_1
                index.html
                main.js
                renderer.js
```



To run all tests, use the following:

```js
$ npm run test
```
